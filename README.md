---
In this project we will build a data visualization page using the migration
dataset collected by UNHCR for 2024.

The original dataset for our data visualization can be found [here](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/unhcr-situations).

This is purely an exercise in data-visualization by using Streamlit and thus the facts and figures on this page though extracted from an official UNHCR dataset should not be considered
as the facts on the ground for the period covered.
